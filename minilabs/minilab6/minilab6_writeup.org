* Question 2
  The algorithm I produced could be changed very easily to use doubles instead
  of chars. By changing the type of the array and the size calculation to
  doubles, the algorithm would work correctly. Alternatively, the code could be
  abstracted out into a templated function, which would then be easily
  manipulated to handle nearly any type of data. I have not provided an example,
  but the solution would be a good template exercise.

* Question 3
  1. { A } Write A
  2. { B, A } Write B
  3. { A } Read
  4. { C, A } Write C
  5. { A } Read
  6. { D, A } Write D

* Question 4
  1. { A } Write A
  2. { A, B } Write B
  3. { B } Read
  4. { B, C } Write C
  5. { C } Read
  6. { C, D } Write D
