* Passing by reference vs passing by value
** Pass by reference.
   Passing by reference allows a function to mutate a variable that is outside
   its scope without creating side-effects. It also prevents copying of the
   variable, saving memory.

   The disadvantages are that the data is more vulnerable since the function can
   do whatever it wants to the passed value without any policy enforcement.

** Pass by value
   The advantages and disadvantages to pass by value are simply the inverse of
   pass by reference.  Pass by value limits control but improves security, while
   pass by reference increases control, but requires responsibility and
   knowledge on the part of the programmer.
