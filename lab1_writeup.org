* Description of Algorithm
  The program begins by creating an empty array with size /n/ set by
  the user.  The first for loop iterates from 0 to n-1 in increments
  of 1, and assigns the value of the iterator, to the same value index
  of the array.  The second loop, which performs a swap, iterates from
  0 to =n / 2=. Each iteration starts by storing the value at the
  iterator index in a temporary variable. The next step is to replace
  the current index with the value at index /n - current index/. This
  repeats for /n / 2/ times.  This covers both cases where n is odd or
  even, since if it is odd, the middle value will be in the same
  index, regardless if the array is swapped or not. Following the
  swap, the program prints the contents of the array to the user to
  verify it was swapped correctly.
